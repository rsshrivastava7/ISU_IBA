            <h2>IBA Distinguished Senior Fellowship</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Criteria</h3>
                 <p class="long-copy">Successful candidates for the IBA Distinguished Senior Fellowship must be established senior scholars who have made outstanding scientific achievements, have demonstrated a record of exceptional scientific contributions, and have provided active leadership in mathematical biology both as researchers and educators. This fellowship is awarded to those at associate or full professor rank (or the equivalent) who exemplify not only an outstanding level of scientific achievement but also, through mentoring and leadership, have created scientific opportunities for the future scholars of the field.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Nomination</h3>
                <p class="long-copy">In order to be considered for an IBA Distinguished Senior Fellowship, a candidate must have a letter of nomination from a senior researcher, as self-nominations are not accepted.</p>
                <p class="long-copy">Nomination Letters and Letters of Support are important elements of the selection process and are read carefully by the Selection Committee. The letters allow nominators and support writers to give committee members insights about a nominee that are not present in their other application materials (CV, publication list, etc.). The Selection Committee recommends that letters of support be submitted by someone who can speak objectively and knowledgeably about the quality and significance of a nominee’s work. Letters submitted by co-authors, personal associates, or professional mentors are, in this sense, less useful to the Selection Committee than letters submitted by those with more professional distance from a nominee’s work.</p>

                 <ul>
                         <li>A letter from a senior researcher officially nominating the candidate and describing his or her qualifications, initiative, and research;</li>
                         <li>The candidate’s curriculum vitae (including a list of the candidate’s scientific publications);</li>
                         <li>Three representative articles by the candidate;</li>
                         <li>Two letters from other researchers (preferably not all from the same institution) written in support of the candidate’s nomination.</li>

                <h3>Selection</h3>
                <p class="long-copy">Nominations are reviewed and candidates selected by an independent selection committee of distinguished scientists in the field of mathematical biology. Fellows are selected on the basis of their outstanding s​cientific achievements coupled with a record of active leadership in mentoring scientific careers.</p>
