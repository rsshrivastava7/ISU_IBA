            <h2>IBA Distinguished Fellowship Awards</h2>
            <div>
                <p class="long-copy">The Intercollegiate Biomathematics Alliance Distinguished Fellowship has been established to honor scholars with outstanding contributions to mathematical biology. The award has two versions:</p>

                <p class="long-copy">The Distinguished Senior Fellowship is awarded to established senior scholars who have made outstanding scientific achievements, demonstrated a record of exceptional scientific contributions and active leadership in mathematical biology both as researchers and educators. This fellowship is awarded on even-numbered years to those at associate of full professor rank, who exemplify not only an outstanding level of scientific endeavor but also a mentoring and leadership which helped create scientific opportunities for the future scholars of the field.</p>
                <p class="long-copy">The Distinguished Junior Fellowship is awarded to those who have a strong record of significant independent research accomplishments that demonstrate creativity and the potential to become future leaders in the mathematical biology community. Nominated candidates are normally below the rank of associate professor and do not hold tenure, but these are not strict requirements. This fellowship is awarded on odd-numbered years.</p>
                <p class="long-copy">The awards are announced on the closing day of the <a href="https://about.illinoisstate.edu/biomath/beer/Pages/default.aspx">Symposium in Biomathematics and Ecology Education and Research</a></p>
                <p class="long-copy">The Distinguished Senior Fellowship awardees are invited to the Symposium on Biomathematics and Ecology Education and Research as plenary speakers the following year and expected to submit a Review Article to Letters in Biomathematics describing important problems of their research field and its future directions. Fellowship awardees are also given a plaque and monetary award to cover their travel expenses to the meeting.</p>
                <p class="long-copy">The Distinguished Junior Fellowship awardees are invited to the Midwest Mathematical Biology Conferenceâ€‹ as plenary speakers the following year and expected to submit a research article to Letters in Biomathematics related to their research field. Fellowship awardees are given a plaque and monetary award to cover their travel expenses to the meeting.</p>
                <p class="long-copy">More information on criteria, nomination process, required material for nominations, and selection process can be found at the following webpages:</p>
